SSH into your Raspberry Pi. Now, you need to add the Mosquitto repository. Enter the following commands:
sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
sudo rm mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
Next, make the repository available to apt-get. First we need to change to the apt sources list directory:
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
Now install the packages list for your Raspbian.
sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-jessie.list
Now update apt information and install Mosquitto.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto
Next we can install the three parts of Mosquitto proper.
mosquitto – the MQTT broker (or in other words, a server)
mosquitto-clients – command line clients, very useful in debugging
python-mosquitto – the Python language bindings
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients python-mosquitto
Now the broker is immediately started.  Since we have to configure it first, stop it by command:
sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop
We need to set up the configuration file. The configuration files is located at /etc/mosquitto. Open the config file:
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
 
File should look like this:

# Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
#
# A full description of the configuration file is at
# /usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example
pid_file /var/run/mosquitto.pid
persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/
log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log
include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
Now replace “log_dest file /v…” line with “log_dest topic”. And add following 6 lines:

log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information
connection_messages true
log_timestamp true
Now the file should look like this:

# Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
#
# A full description of the configuration file is at
# /usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example
pid_file /var/run/mosquitto.pid
persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/
log_dest topic
log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information
connection_messages true
log_timestamp true
include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
Start the mosquito server:
sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto start
Test your installation by opening 2 two terminal windows to the first insert:
mosquitto_sub -d -t hello/world
 
And to the second window insert:
mosquitto_pub -d -t hello/world -m "Hello from Terminal window 2!"
 
When you have done the second statement you should see this in the Terminal 1 window:
~ $ sudo mosquitto_sub -d -t hello/world
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm sending CONNECT
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm received CONNACK
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm sending SUBSCRIBE (Mid: 1, Topic: hello/world, QoS: 0)
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm received SUBACK
Subscribed (mid: 1): 0
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm received PUBLISH (d0, q0, r0, m0, 'hello/world', ... (32 bytes))
Greetings from Terminal window 2
On Linux version 4.4.50/ Raspbian v. 8 (jessie) and mosquitto MQTT v3.1 the mosquitto will start on boot automatically.
